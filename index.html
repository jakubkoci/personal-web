      <section>
        <p>Hi, I’m Jakub, a software engineer and consultant in self-sovereign identity and blockchain technologies.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          I’m currently working on self-sovereign identity solutions for Absa bank. I have a strong interest in
          blockchain innovations and distributed systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a full-stack software engineer, I write code mainly in JavaScript (React/React Native, Node.js). I have
          also extensive experience with Java. I learned functional programming with Clojure and currently studying the
          beauty and ugliness of Rust. I believe in best practices like clean code, TDD, CI and automation. I try to
          learn something new every single day.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spent vast majority of my career in FinTech. My field of study at collage was Economics Informatics.
          Therefore, I have good understanding of economics, finance, business, management and marketing which I try to
          apply in my day to day job. I think that a good understanding of business needs is crucial in the sofware
          development industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like coffee, rock music, travelling, ice-hockey, playing guitar ☕️🎸 🗺 🏒
