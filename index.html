        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a product-minded software engineer and craftsman. My passion is
          building digital products. I have various experiences across the
          stack, from backend development over web and mobile frontend
          development to UX/UI design.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current area of interest are decentralized technologies having a
          strong expertise in self-sovereign identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I write code mainly in TypeScript/JavaScript (React/React Native,
          Node.js). I also have extensive experience with Java. I learned
          functional programming with Clojure and I've played around a bit with
          Rust. I strive for simplicity and application of best practices like
          clean code, TDD, and DevOps. I love learning and learning by teaching.
          I'm a co-host of a podcast about software craftsmanship (in Czech). I
          was a co-organizer and mentor at several coderetreats.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent the vast majority of my career in FinTech, building and
          maintaining a backend application for the loan approval process,
          creating an extensive client-side application for personal finance
          management from scratch, and now building a mobile app and framework
          for self-sovereign identity.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like ☕️ coffee, 🚴‍♂️ cycling, 🏒 ice hockey, 🗺 traveling, 🏛️
          architecture & design, 🎸 rock music and playing guitar.
