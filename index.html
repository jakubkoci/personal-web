        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, I‚Äôm Jakub, a product-minded software engineer and craftsman with
          various experiences across the stack, from backend, web and mobile
          frontend to UX/UI. I have a passion for building digital products and
          connecting business, technology and people.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current area of interest and expertise is
          <strong>self-sovereign identity</strong> or
          <strong>decentralized digital identity</strong> and blockchain. I‚Äôm
          working on self-sovereign identity solutions for Absa bank and
          contributing to Hyperledger Indy and Aries open-source projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I write code mainly in JavaScript or TypeScript (React/React Native,
          Node.js). I also have extensive experience with Java. I learned
          functional programming with Clojure and currently playing with Rust
          from time to time. I strive for simplicity and believe in best
          practices like clean code, TDD, and DevOps. I love learning and
          learning by teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent the vast majority of my career in FinTech, building and
          maintaining a backend application for the loan approval process,
          creating an extensive client-side application for personal finance
          management from scratch, and now building a mobile app and framework
          for self-sovereign identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          My field of study at college was Economics Informatics. Therefore, I
          have a good understanding of economics, finance, business, and
          management, which I try to apply in my day-to-day job. I think that a
          good understanding of business needs is crucial in the software
          development industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like coffee, rock music, traveling, ice hockey, playing guitar.
